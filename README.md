# Building-a-Spam-Classifier
I will be using the Naive Bayes algorithm to create a model that can classify dataset SMS messages as spam or not spam, based on the training we give to the model. 

# The Steps that i moved through
1) Importing the dataset and splitting the output and the input
2) Implementing Bag of Words from scratch - #just for learning# i did not use it.
3) Splitting the Training and testing sets
4) Implementing Bag of Words in scikit-learn
5) Naive Bayes implementation using scikit-learn
6) make predictions on the test data
7) Evaluating the model
I got :
# Accuracy score:  0.9928263988522238
# Precision score:  0.9777777777777777
# Recall score:  0.967032967032967
# F1 score:  0.9723756906077348
